# ToDoReactRedux

This is a small project which allows you to create, edit and delete todo entries on a webpanel using react and react-redux as a state management engine. I made this to get myself started on react and redux, this is far from perfect, since it's my first try.

## Usage

You can launch this yourself by dispatching the following commands:
* ```yarn install``` (just initially, to get node_modules)
* ```yarn start``` (to launch dev server)
